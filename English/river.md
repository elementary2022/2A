Once upon a time, there was a little horse named Xiao Ma. Xiao Ma lived near a river and loved to explore. One day, Xiao Ma decided to cross the river to see what was on the other side.

But there was a problem. The river was deep, and Xiao Ma didn't know how to swim. Xiao Ma felt worried and unsure about what to do.

Just as Xiao Ma was pondering, a kind-hearted duck came along. The duck saw Xiao Ma's dilemma and offered to help. The duck said, "Jump on my back, Xiao Ma. I will take you safely across the river."

Xiao Ma trusted the duck and hopped onto its back. The duck paddled through the water, carrying Xiao Ma across the river. Xiao Ma felt a little scared at first, but the duck's gentle movements made it feel secure.

With the duck's help, Xiao Ma successfully reached the other side of the river. Xiao Ma was thrilled to explore the new land and thanked the duck for its kindness.

From that day on, Xiao Ma and the duck became good friends. They often played together and helped each other in times of need. Xiao Ma learned that sometimes, with a friend's support, even the most challenging obstacles can be overcome.

And so, Xiao Ma's adventure across the river became a cherished memory, reminding them of the importance of friendship and teamwork.
